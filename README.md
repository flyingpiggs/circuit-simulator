# circuit-simulator
Personal notes for the time being...

Need to port over the generator code from previous project for test vector
generation. I'm pretty sure I can just use the code directly...

Finish the BFS for circuit simulation

A lot of user experience thing need to be refined. I also need to give
some consideration to how to design the code. I think I should put most,
if not all of the code that is related to getting user input into main()
